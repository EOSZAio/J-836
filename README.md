# J-836

## Synopsis

This project provides a tech solution for J 8:36 project (http://lovesetsfree.co.za/). This project aims to create an organized market for waste pickers and recycling companies without the need for a middleman. The business model implemented is based on the concepts of a DAO.

## Benefits

The J836 project aims to benefit all stakeholders as follows;

### Local communities

The attitude of local communities towards waste pickers ranges form nuisance. (best case) to hostile. The J-826 project seeks to improve this relationship by creating visibility on the role of waste pickers in the processing of recyclables.

### Waste pickers

Waste pickers do not enjoy the support of local communities and are usually seen as a nuisance. The J-826 project seeks to encourage communities to separate recyclables at source. This will eliminate the need for pickers to rummage through trash. It also improves the efficiency of the pickers.

Buyers of recyclables deal directly with individual or small groups of pickers. The result is lack of competition in the market and low prices. J-826 aims to create a market for recyclables.

### Recycling companies

Better organisation and efficiency of pickers should result in better yields and more reliable supply. In addition, this project aims to remove the need to deal in cash with it's associated risks.
