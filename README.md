# J-836

## Synopsis

This project provides a tech solution for J 8:36 project (http://lovesetsfree.co.za/). This project aims to create an organized market for waste pickers and recycling companies without the need for a middleman. The business model implemented is based on the concepts of a DAO.

## Benefits

The J836 project aims to benefit all stakeholders as follows;

### Local communities

The attitude of local communities towards waste pickers ranges form nuisance. (best case) to hostile. The J-826 project seeks to improve this relationship by creating visibility on the role of waste pickers in the processing of recyclables.

### Waste pickers

Waste pickers currently operate independently of each other. They do not enjoy the support of local communities and are usually seen as a nuisance. The J-826 project seeks to encourage communities to separate recyclables at source. This will eliminate the need for pickers to rummage through trash. It also improves the efficiency of the pickers.
